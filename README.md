AIM is an experiment in making an SVG editor that runs in the web browser

The premise draws a lot of parallels to Vim in that it's desgined to be a lightweight paradigm that's tough to get into but pays off in the long term. With heavy use of hotkeys.

For example, key motions: 

g
	x
	y
		<no>

The 'j' hotkey will position the cursor, the following x or y key specifices the axis and the following numeric value specifices the co-ordinate.

Whether or not this will end up being written in JavaScript in the long term is debatable. There are some advantages that make sense logically (like SVG being XML based), but of course there are disadvantages. Like JavaScript's fickle and roundabout ways of writing to the file system.

It's unlikely this project will go anywhere special, so don't expect quality code organized in a logical fashion or any kind of sensical workflow. If you happen to be taking a look at this repo and you're interested in graphic design, then please give me all your thoughts :)
